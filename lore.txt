--scene: startIntro
You come from one of five towns,
 all of which are intent on retrieving the Super Legendary Premium Filtered Water.

The water all the towns have is simply just regular Tap Water,
 and it doesn’t have any flavor to it.

Neither does the Super Legendary Premium Filtered Water,
 to be fair,
 but it’s the status that matters.

You simply need it.

--lineBreak
Filled with desire to obtain the Super Legendary Premium Filtered Water,
 you set out on an arduous journey to reach the Palace of Water,

where the Super Legendary Premium Filtered Water is kept in abundance,
 although it can only be taken by the most worthy.

--lineBreak
June 7th, the most auspicious day in this world to reach the Palace of Water,
 was rapidly approaching.

You made it your goal to come out on top,
 and in the process,
 obtain the Super Legendary Premium Filtered Water that the legends had spoken of.

All of your ancestors had failed,
 and now it was up to you to obtain it.

--lineBreak
Drinking a nice good cup of regular Tap Water,
 you sign up for the town tournament as:

Looking at the tournament bracket,
 you notice your first opponent’s name,
 Reeco. The name of
 a good childhood friend.

--scene: endBattle1
“Wow,
 [username],
 you’re good,”
 Reeco chokes out.
 “I underestimated how far you’ve come since we were kids!”

--lineBreak
“Thanks,
 Reeco,”
 you said solemnly.
 “You were great,
 too.”

--lineBreak
“Just don’t forget us,
 okay?
 I believe in you.
 You can get the Super Legendary Premium Filtered Water!”

He exclaims,
 before passing out.

--lineBreak
After defeating your friend,
 you begin to prepare for your next fight,
 against someone who called themselves Kasra.

You’ve never heard of them, but you assumed the worst.

While entering the arena,
 you drink some more Tap Water,
 before drawing your sword.
--end

--scene: endBattle2
After knocking the weapon out of Kasra’s hand,
 he walks away without saying a word.

Finally, the last battle had come.
 It was against the legendary swordsman Bebald themselves.

As you stepped into the arena,
 however, all was silent.
 After about 3 minutes of awkward silence,

the announcer stood up,
 and cleared his throat.

--lineBreak
“It appears that Bebald has not shown up to the tournament,
 so by default,
 [username],
 is the winner!”

--lineBreak
The crowd erupted with cheers,
 and you walked away with your heart light.

You could finally journey off in search of the Super Legendary Premium Filtered Water,
 your childhood dream.

--lineBreak
Before setting off,
 the village elders bestowed upon you five gifts.

The first,
 a Bronze Sword x1 that was far superior to your training sword.

The second,
 a bottle of Filtered Water x1.

The third,
 a nice bag to store anything you came across in your quest.

The Fourth,
 a bag that contained fifty currency,
 and a hundred premium currency.

--lineBreak
“We don’t know what these are, we don’t know what they do,
 but they’re probably important,”

the village elders had explained. Well, whatever.
 Might as well take it along.

And finally,
 for the fifth and final gift,
 a bundle of Holy Water x5 for emergencies.

--lineBreak
Thanking the village elders, you set off on your journey,
 before hearing your name being called.

--lineBreak
“Hey, {username}! {username}!” You hear from behind. You turn around,
 and you see Reeco running from behind,

panting as he tries to catch up to you.

--lineBreak
“Hey,” he wheezed out, upon catching up to you. “Take this Childhood Photo x1.
 It might bring you luck on your journey.”

--lineBreak
“Reeco... thank you, I’ll cherish this.” Reeco nods, and you turn away,
 stashing the photo as you go.

--lineBreak
It’s time to find that Super Legendary Premium Filtered Water!
